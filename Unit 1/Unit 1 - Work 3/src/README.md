# Binary Search Tree (BST) Challenges

This repository contains solutions to two challenges involving operations on a Binary Search Tree (BST).

## Challenge 01

The first challenge involves finding the closest value in a BST to a given target integer value. The solution uses an iterative approach to traverse the BST, updating the nearest value as it goes.

## Challenge 02

The second challenge proposes the creation of a function to identify the kth largest value present in the BST. To do this, we use a traversal in reverse order (right, root, left) through the tree, counting the nodes visited until reaching the kth largest value.

## Video Explanation

A detailed explanation of the solutions for both challenges can be found in the following video: [Explanation of Solutions](https://www.loom.com/share/6cc281b28617410ba27515dfc1fab4b7?sid=ba641564-ee10-4858-bd7c-1a84523d30d7)

## Tests

The tests for the solutions to the challenges can be found in the files `test_closest_value.py` and `test_kth_largest_value.py`. To run the tests, use the `pytest` command in the terminal.

## Complexity

The time and space complexity of solving the challenges is discussed in detail in the explanation video.
